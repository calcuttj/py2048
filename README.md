# py2048

Homebrewed version of [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)). I eventually want to turn this into an AI/deep learning project project. 

Required python libraries:
* pygame
* numpy

To run the game:
<pre>
python main.py
</pre>

The maximum tile currently goes up only to 256 because I got lazy making tiles past that. It currently crashes beyond that. Will update soon.
